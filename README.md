# Homework 4 (Due OCT 5th)

Part 1:
Describe Batch Normalization.

Part 2:
Load the MNIST Fashion Dataset from Keras:
[MNIST Fashion DatasetLinks to an external site.](https://keras.io/api/datasets/fashion_mnist/)

Create several neural network models to investigate the effect of hyperparameters and techniques we studied on model performance. Consider the following factors:

1. Number of layers
2. Number of neurons in hidden layers
3. Optimizers
4. Batch size and learning rate in gradient descent optimizers
5. L1 and L2 regularization
6. Dropout
7. Batch normalization
8. Weight and bias initialization

# Homework 3 (Due Sep 22nd)
Please specify you name beside the problem you want to in charge of 

PART 1 (**Jayaprakash,**)

   1. Why is output of σ in the interval (0, 1)?
   2. Why the output of σ cannot equal 0 or 1?
   3. For what value of z is σ(z) = 0.5?
   4. Show that σ′(z) = σ(z) · (1 − σ(z)).

PART 2 (**Yuzhen Hu,Deekshitha Gona**)

Use the HR.csv dataset and consider the column “left” as the target variable:
“1” meaning the person left the company.

“0” meaning that the person did not leave the company.

Investigate using various graphs/charts how the given features affect the target variable.

Choose several features and build an sklearn logistic regression model predicting the target variable “left”.

Discuss the model performance, including the confusion matrix and the classification report, on the test set.
