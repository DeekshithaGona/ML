Dataset Description:
Consider the wine.csv dataset, attached on OneDrive. It contains 13 attributes (columns 2–14).

The first column, "wine", is the target variable. This dataset can also be used for classification.
For unsupervised learning algorithms, ignore the "wine" column.
Tasks:
a. Clustering:

Create clusters using the following algorithms:
i. K-Means Clustering
ii. Agglomerative Clustering
iii. DBSCAN
Investigate the values of hyperparameters for each of these algorithms.
Analyze the quality of clustering solutions.
Identify and select the best clustering solution.
b. Visualization:

Plot the best clustering solution in two dimensions using:
i. Pairs of attributes.
ii. Principal Component Analysis (PCA).
c. Comparison:

Compare the labels of the best clustering solution with the original data labels in the column "wine". generate readme file with this
